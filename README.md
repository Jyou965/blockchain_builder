## Libraries and Dependancies

* [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/) - an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science.

* [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) - provides a decorator and functions for automatically adding generated special methods such as __init__() and __repr__() to user-defined classes.

* [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) - provides runtime support for type hints as specified by PEP 484, PEP 526, PEP 544, PEP 586, PEP 589, and PEP 591. The most fundamental support consists of the types Any, Union, Tuple, Callable, TypeVar, and Generic.

* [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) - supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

* [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) - implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms. Included are the FIPS secure hash algorithms SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 (defined in FIPS 180-2) as well as RSAâ€™s MD5 algorithm (defined in Internet RFC 1321).

## Usage

The application operates in the following steps:

1. Create a Record Data Class.

2. Build a Block Data Class to Store Data and add the cache decorator for Streamlit.

3. In the Streamlit Interface, add relevant User Inputs, build the Ledger, the Block Inspector and the Validation button.

Users of this application can adapt the code to build blockchains of their own in a timely manner.
